## Rational - datatype;

To work with datatype, write this:
```cpp
#include "rational.h"
```

**Create object:**

To create an object write:
```cpp
Rational(); // 0
Rational(10); // 10/1
Rational(1, 5); // 1/5
```

As a replacement for abs and sqrt, I wrote my functions and put them in a separate module.
To work:
```cpp
#include "bmath.h"
```
